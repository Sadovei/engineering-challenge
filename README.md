# The Journey

The environment we have at Staking Rewards and the engineers you'll work with dictate these three expectations:

1. You're a well-rounded engineer
2. Comfortable in unfamiliar situations
3. And have an unquenchable thirst for knowledge

This is why we're calling this a journey not a challenge. We'd like you to venture
into an uncharted territory, have fun while doing it and treat yourself to a difficult but
interesting engineering task.

This means we don't expect you to complete the task, unless you're absolutely intrigued by it, have or can
develop the skills in the alloted time and don't like to leave things unfinished which
gives you more plus points obviously.

However, the purpose is to see what you could accomplish on a tight time budget and doing a task that on the surface, looks like a hellish uphill climb. It isn't.

Did I lose you? No, wonderful! Grab yourself some coffee, or tea for that matter and dive right in.

## Spreadsheets

> Trivia: Did you know that the concept of electronic spreadsheets dates back to 1961
> when it was first outlined in a paper titled "Budgeting Models and System Simulation" by Richard Mattessich

Pretty neat huh? Yeah, that's straight from Wikipedia. It's a fun read if you're into that kind of thing but in any case, back to the task.

## Instructions

To kick off your journey, just check out the frontend or backend branch depending on whatever challenge you'd like to solve. The technical instructions can be found in there.

To complete the challenge, you have one week of time. Use it wisely.
Once you decide, that you are done and you did your best, send uns the code to talent@stakingrewards.com.
